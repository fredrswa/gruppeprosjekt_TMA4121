#Project for course TMA4121 at NTNU

A numerical calculation of the Heat Equation in two dimensions and a plot against measured values. Results are stored in /figures comparing the values in a specified point and also animating the whole "plate"


heat_equation.cpp runs the whole script and saves files in /figures



heat_equation.txt saves values calculated in the cpp file for animating.
heat_equation.py is called by the cpp file, but can be run seperately for plotting without calculating.


*The whole script is at the moment specifically designed to align with the project as a simulation for the measured values.
